## About This Project

This project, *Spotify Drop-Off Analysis,* is a data analysis initiative aimed at understanding and mitigating customer churn for a music streaming service. The primary objective was to leverage data to identify the root causes of user drop-off and translate those findings into strategic business recommendations.

### *Project Goals*

* *Analyze Churn:* Investigate user behavior and complaint data to uncover patterns associated with customer drop-off.

* *Visualize Data:* Design an intuitive and interactive dashboard to present complex data in a digestible format for stakeholders.

### *Technology Stack*

The following tools and technologies were utilized throughout the project lifecycle:

* *SQL:* Used for the initial data cleaning, transformation, and preparation. SQL was essential for ensuring data integrity and structuring the dataset for analysis.
* *Power BI:* The primary tool for data visualization and building the interactive dashboard. Power BI was used to create compelling charts, graphs, and slicers that bring the data to life and allow for dynamic exploration.

### *Key Project Features*

* *Interactive Dashboard:* A live, dynamic Power BI dashboard that allows users to filter data by month, year, and other dimensions.
* *Complaint-Churn Correlation:* A core analysis section that quantifies the link between customer complaints and their drop-off outcome.
