# Spotify Drop-Off Analysis
A strategic data analysis project that uses SQL and Power BI to identify key drivers of customer churn for a music streaming service, "Spotify."


### Key Findings & Strategic Recommendations

Based on the in-depth analysis of the provided data, we have identified several critical insights that translate into powerful business recommendations:

- Complaint Resolution is Crucial: A significant number of users who issued complaints—especially critical ones—ultimately dropped off. This strong correlation identifies a direct link between unresolved issues and customer churn.
    - Recommendation: Implement a prioritized complaint resolution system. Focus on fast-tracking and effectively resolving critical complaints to prevent the loss of high-value users.

- High-Usage Users are at Risk: Contrary to the assumption that only inactive users churn, the data reveals that nearly 28% of dropped users were in the "High" usage hours category. This highlights that a good user experience is paramount for all segments.
    - Recommendation: Develop a proactive "High-Usage User Retention" program. Use targeted communication to solicit feedback from this loyal segment and offer exclusive perks or personalized content to maintain their engagement.

- Churn is Consistent Across Subscription Tiers: The drop-off count is surprisingly balanced across Free, Basic, and Premium users. This indicates that churn is a systemic issue, not a problem isolated to a single user segment.
    - Recommendation: Tailor retention strategies for each segment. For Free users, focus on converting them by highlighting the benefits of a paid plan. For Premium users, continuously reinforce the value proposition of their subscription to prevent them from seeking alternatives.

- Drop-Off is a Seasonal Challenge: The analysis shows a noticeable spike in churn during specific months. These seasonal trends are crucial for strategic planning.
    - Recommendation: Proactively plan targeted re-engagement campaigns in anticipation of these seasonal peaks. Identify at-risk users before these periods and provide incentives to prevent drop-off.

### Dashboard Analysis Breakdown

The project dashboard is an interactive tool built with Power BI to provide a 360-degree view of customer drop-off. The following key visuals and metrics are included:

- Total/Active/Dropped Users: The top-level metrics give an immediate snapshot of the platform's health. The high drop-off rate is the primary metric this analysis aims to address.
- Customer Complaints vs. Drop-Off Outcome: This bar chart is the cornerstone of the analysis, visually demonstrating the strong link between complaint severity and user churn.
- Dropped Customers by Subscription Type: This horizontal bar chart breaks down churn by subscription tier, revealing that the problem is not limited to any single user segment.
- Dropped Customers by Usage Hours: A compelling donut chart that challenges the assumption that only low-usage users leave, highlighting the importance of retaining active listeners.
- Monthly Customer Drop Count: A line chart that provides a clean, visual representation of the seasonal trends in churn, which is critical for planning future retention efforts.

### Methodology & Tools

- Data Source: The analysis is based on a simulated dataset representing customer behavior, complaint logs, and subscription information from a music streaming service.
- Tools Used:
    - Data Cleaning & Preparation: SQL
    - Data Analysis & Visualization: Power BI
- Approach: An exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach was used to identify patterns and correlations, culminating in a final dashboard that communicates the key findings effectively to stakeholders.

### Future Work & Enhancements

- Predictive Modeling: Build a machine learning model to predict which users are most likely to drop off in the coming month.
- Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on the complaint data to better understand the nuances behind customer dissatisfaction.
- A/B Testing Recommendations: Use these insights to design and propose A/B tests for product changes or marketing campaigns aimed at reducing churn.
