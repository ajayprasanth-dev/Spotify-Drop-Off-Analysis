# Project Overview – Spotify Drop-Off Analysis

## 1. Introduction
Customer churn is a critical challenge for streaming platforms like Spotify. Understanding why users leave is essential to improve retention, maximize lifetime value, and drive growth. This project analyzes simulated Spotify user data, including subscriptions, complaints, and usage patterns, to uncover churn drivers and provide actionable recommendations.

## 2. Business Problem
High churn negatively impacts revenue and long-term platform growth. While conventional wisdom suggests low-usage users are at risk, analysis shows that **even high-usage, loyal users can drop off**. The objective is to identify **why users leave** and propose strategies to retain them effectively.

## 3. Data & Tools
**Data Sources:**  
- Simulated customer data containing subscription type, complaint logs, usage hours, and drop-off status.  

**Tools Used:**  
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, standardization, and preparation.  
- **Excel** – Exploratory analysis and validation through pivot tables and quick aggregations.  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation, DAX measures, and dynamic visualizations.

## 4. Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning (SQL):**  
   - Standardized subscription types and usage data.  
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values.  
   - Created structured tables for analysis.  

2. **Data Validation (Excel):**  
   - Pivot tables and summary statistics to verify SQL-cleaned data.  
   - Quick checks on patterns and anomalies.  

3. **Dashboard Building (Power BI):**  
   - Designed dynamic visuals and filters (slicers) for insights.  
   - Created charts for churn by complaint severity, subscription type, usage hours, and month.  
   - Developed an interactive dashboard to explore trends in real-time.

## 5. Key Findings
- **Complaint Severity Drives Churn:** Unresolved critical complaints correlate with high drop-off rates.  
- **High-Usage Users Are Vulnerable:** Approximately 28% of churned users were high-usage, contradicting assumptions that only low-engagement users leave.  
- **Churn Across Subscription Tiers:** Drop-offs are consistent across Free, Basic, and Premium subscriptions, indicating a systemic issue.  
- **Seasonal Peaks in Churn:** Certain months exhibit higher churn, signaling the need for proactive campaigns.

## 6. Recommendations
- Implement a **priority complaint resolution system** for critical issues.  
- Launch a **retention program for high-usage users**, including personalized offers and exclusive content.  
- Tailor retention strategies for each **subscription tier**, upselling Free users and reinforcing Premium value.  
- Plan **seasonal re-engagement campaigns** before high-risk months.
